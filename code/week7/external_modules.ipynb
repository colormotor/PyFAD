    "        One of the first hits will be [this page](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scipy). You want use the first install command containing &ldquo;conda-forge&rdquo;, i.e. `conda install conda-forge::scipy`. But you can **replace `conda` with `mamba`** with the only difference being that Mamba is much faster than Conda.\n",

Pip will install things without checking for conflicts and might totally break your environment!
